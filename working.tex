Modelling and simulating in large scale, complex socio-technical systems
engineering projects is an on-going research challenge.  Existing methods and
notations are largely derived from a classical engineering abstract, reduce, and
refine technique.  Unfortunately, these principles are confounded by
socio-technical systems problems, which resist the separation of concerns
necessary for abstraction and reduction.  As a consequence, modelling
socio-technical systems using these techniques will typically either result in a
model that is tractable, but lacks the necessary detail of the underlying system
to provide informative results; so narrow in scope as to be uninformative about
the behaviour of the wider system of interest; or so large and complex as to be
intractable for analysis.

A critical aspect of these challenges is the non-determinism and variance in
behaviour exhibited by socio-technical systems.

This variance may be caused by a variety of factors including natural
variability in human decision making, external pressures on the system, such as
loss of resources,...

This paper presents a novel approach to simulating and measuring the effect of
variance in socio-technical behaviours on overall system performance.  Systems
are modelled as collections of idealised workflows, constructed from a modular
toolkit of actions for a problem domain.  Properties for good outcomes.

  These workflows are then subjected to
`fuzzing' in order to simulate the effects of variance in the system.

In this section we introduce our approach to modelling idealised workflows in
socio-technical systems and then introducing variance in their execution through
fuzzing.
