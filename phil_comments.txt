What evidence is presented in the paper

Need to show proof that fuzzing shows that

The hypothesis is too futuristic: what can you claim now?

De-emhpasise this

Bring the paper back down to the small steps that you have actually achieved.

Find *something* that claims folklore software engineering 

Write the contributions down FIRST.

STATE THE WHY BEHIND THE EVALUATION

Conclusions: Without any contingent behaviour, the models look comparable.

workflow statements -> not statements

features -> features implement

#mtf -> mtf.
