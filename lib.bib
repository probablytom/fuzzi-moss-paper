abstract = {This specification defines the Unified Modeling Language (UML), revision 2. The objective of UML is to provide system architects, software engineers, and software developers with tools for analysis, design, and implementation of softwarebased systems as well as for modeling business and similar processes. The initial versions of UML (UML 1) originated with three leading object-oriented methods (Booch, OMT, and OOSE), and incorporated a number of best practices from modeling language design, object-oriented programming, and architectural description languages. Relative to UML 1, this revision of UML has been enhanced with significantly more precise definitions of its abstract syntax rules and semantics, a more modular language structure, and a greatly improved capability for modeling large-scale systems. One of the primary goals of UML is to advance the state of the industry by enabling object visual modeling tool interoperability. However, to enable meaningful exchange of model information between tools, agreement on semantics and notation is required. UML meets the following requirements: A formal definition of a common MOF-based metamodel that specifies the abstract syntax of the UML. The abstract syntax defines the set of UML modeling concepts, their attributes and their relationships, as well as the rules for combining these concepts to construct partial or complete UML models. A detailed explanation of the semantics of each UML modeling concept. The semantics define, in a technologyindependent manner, how the UML concepts are to be realized by computers. A specification of the human-readable notation elements for representing the individual UML modeling concepts as well as rules for combining them into a variety of different diagram types corresponding to different aspects of modeled systems. A detailed definition of ways in which UML tools can be made compliant with this specification. This is supported (in a separate specification) with an XML-based specification of corresponding model interchange formats (XMI) that must be realized by compliant tools.},

We elucidate major differences between the practical orientation of EM and theoretical orientation of other ethnographic approaches in information science research. We address ways in which EM may be used to inform systems design and consider the issues that arise in coordinating the results of this research with the needs of information systems designers. We outline our approach to the “ethnographically informed” development of information systems in addressing some of the major problems of interdisciplinary work between system designers and EM researchers.},

@article{Baxter2011,
abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that adopting a socio-technical approach to system development leads to systems that are more acceptable to end users and deliver better value to stakeholders. Despite this, such approaches are not widely practised. We analyse the reasons for this, highlighting some of the problems with the better known socio-technical design methods. Based on this analysis we propose a new pragmatic framework for socio-technical systems engineering (STSE) which builds on the (largely independent) research of groups investigating work design, information systems, computer-supported cooperative work, and cognitive systems engineering. STSE bridges the traditional gap between organisational change and system development using two main types of activity: sensitisation and awareness; and constructive engagement. From the framework, we identify an initial set of interdisciplinary research problems that address how to apply socio-technical approaches in a cost-effective way, and how to facilitate the integration of STSE with existing systems and software engineering approaches. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Obligations can apply to individuals, either severally or collectively. When applied severally, each individual or member of a team is independently responsible to fulfill the obligation. When applied collectively, it is the group as a whole that becomes responsible, with individual members sharing the obligation. In this paper, we present several variations of teamwork models involving the performance of collective obligations. Some of these rely heavily on a leader to ensure effective teamwork, whereas others leave much room for member autonomy. We strongly focus on the implementation of such models. We demonstrate how KAoS policies can be used to establish desired forms of cooperation through regulation of agent behavior. Some of these policies concern invariant aspects of teamwork, such as how to behave when a leader is present, how to ensure that actions are properly coordinated, and how to delegate actions. Other policies can be enabled or disabled to regulate the degree of autonomy of the team members. We have implemented a prototype of a Mars-mission scenario that demonstrates varying results when applied across these different teamwork models.},

abstract = {Topics covered include: The fundamentals of business process modeling, including workflow patterns, an in-depth treatment of process flexibility, including approaches to dealing with on-the-fly changes, unexpected exceptions, and constraint-based processes, Technological aspects of a modern BPM environment, including its architecture, process design environment, process engine, resource handler and other support services, a comparative insight into current approaches to business process modeling and execution such as BPMN, EPCs, BPEL, jBPM, OpenWFE, and Enhydra Shark, process mining, verification, integration and configuration; and case studies in health care and screen business. This book provides a comprehensive treatment of the field of Business Process Management (BPM) with a focus on Business Process Automation. It achieves this by covering a wide range of topics, both introductory and advanced, illustrated through and grounded in the YAWL (Yet Another Workflow Language) language and corresponding open-source support environment. In doing so it provides the reader with a deep, timeless, and vendor-independent understanding of the essential ingredients of business process automation. The BPM field is in a continual state of flux and is subject to both the ongoing proposal of new standards and the introduction of new tools and technology. Its fundamentals however are relatively stable and this book aims to equip the reader with both a thorough understanding of them and the ability to apply them to better understand, assess and utilize new developments in the BPM field. As a consequence of its topic-based format and the inclusion of a broad range of exercises, the book is eminently suitable for use in tertiary education, both at the undergraduate and the postgraduate level, for students of computer science and information systems. BPM researchers and practitioners will also find it a valuable resource. The book serves as a uniquereference to a varied and comprehensive collection of topics that are relevant to the business process life-cycle.},

This state-of-the-art survey presents the results of three workshops of the InterLink working group on software-intensive systems and novel computing paradigms. The objective was to imagine the landscape in which next generations of software-intensive systems will operate and the challenges they present to computing, software engineering, cognition and intelligence. The volume starts with an overview of the current state of the art and the research missions in engineering software-intensive systems. The remainder of the book consists of 15 invited papers of the working group participants and is structured in three major parts: ensemble engineering, theory and formal methods, and novel computing paradigms. These papers cover a broad spectrum of relevant topics ranging from methods, languages and tools for ensemble engineering, socio-technical and cyber-physical systems, ensembles in urban environments, formal methods and mathematical foundations for ensembles, orchestration languages to disruptive paradigms such as molecular and chemical computing.},

abstract = {This article presents graphical modeling concepts, especially for the modeling of socio-technical processes. This requires the representation of those parts of knowledge which cannot be stated definitely and have to be modeled vaguely. The presented modeling concepts allow the extension of existing graphical and textual modeling methods to model facts without making unnecessary and unwelcome commitments about not already completed knowledge. In the same way it also allows the modeling of facts which cannot be modeled completely, like aspects of social systems comprising of cooperation and communication. A special modeling notation (SeeMe) is used to present the concepts. A systematic differentiation of vagueness shows the alternative ways for modelers to express vague facts. Expressing undetermined decisions is another element of vague modeling in SeeMe.},

abstract = {Meta-design of socio-technical systems is an approach which complies with the need of integrating two different types of structures and processes: technical systems which are engineered to provide anticipatable and reliable interactions between users and systems, and social systems which are contingent in their interactions and a subject of evolution. Meta-design is focused on objectives, techniques and processes to allow users to act as designers. In doing so, it does not provide fixed solutions but frameworks within which all stakeholders can contribute to the development of technical functionality and the evolution of the social side such as organizational change, knowledge construction, and collaborative learning. This paper combines the theoretical framework of meta-design and its underlying principles with the consideration of methodological aspects and practical cases. Five different principles are explored: (1) cultures of participation, (2) empowerment for adaptation and evolution, (3) seeding and evolutionary growth, (4) underdesign of models of socio-technical processes, and (5) structuring of communication. Design collaboratories and knowledge management are used as examples to analyse meta-designed socio-technical systems representing socio-technical solutions as well as frameworks within which socio-technical solutions can be developed. The combination of theoretical and methodological consideration leads to a set of practical guidelines for meta-designers.},

@article{Cheeseman1991,
abstract = {It is well known that for many NP-complete problems, such as K-Sat, etc., typical cases are easy to solve; so that computationally hard cases must be rare (assuming P 6= NP ). This paper shows that NP-complete problems can be summarized by at least one "order parameter ", and that the hard problems occur at a critical value of such a parameter. This critical value separates two regions of characteristically different properties. For example, for K-colorability, the critical value separates overconstrained from underconstrained random graphs, and it marks the value at which the probability of a solution changes abruptly from near 0 to near 1. It is the high density of wellseparated almost solutions (local minima) at this boundary that cause search algorithms to "thrash". This boundary is a type of phase transition and we show that it is preserved under mappings between problems. We show that for some P problems either there is no phase transition or it occurs for bounded N (and so bounds the cost). These results suggest a way of deciding if a problem is in P or NP and why they are different.},

UNIX1 swept into popu- larity with an industry-wide change from central main- frames to autonomous minis. I suspect that Daniel Bob- row [1] would be here instead of me if he could not afford a PDP-10 and had had to "settle" for a PDP-11. Moreover, the current state of UNIX is the result of the labors of a large number of people. There is an old adage, "Dance with the one that brought you," which means that I should talk about UNIX. I have not worked on mainstream UNIX in many years, yet I continue to get undeserved credit for the work of others. Therefore, I am not going to talk about UNIX, but I want to thank everyone who has contrib- uted. That brings me to Dennis Ritchie. Our collaboration has been a thing of beauty. In the ten years that we have worked together, I can recall only one case of miscoordination of work. On that occasion, I discovered that we both had written the same 20-line assembly language program. I compared the sources and was as- tounded to find that they matched character-for-char- acter. The result of our work together has been far greater than the work that we each contributed. I am a programmer. On my 1040 form, that is what I put down as my occupation. As a programmer, I write programs. I would like to present to you the cutest program I ever wrote. I will do this in three stages and try to bring it together at the end.},

We trace the history of bubble sort, its popularity, and its endurance in the face of pedagogical assertions that code and algorithmic examples used in early courses should be of high quality and adhere to established best practices. This paper is more an historical analysis than a philosophical treatise for the exclusion of bubble sort from books and courses. However, sentiments for exclusion are supported by Knuth [17], "In short, the bubble sort seems to have nothing to recommend it, except a catchy name and the fact that it leads to some interesting theoretical problems." Although bubble sort may not be a best practice sort, perhaps the weight of history is more than enough to compensate and provide for its longevity.},

In this article, we present successful collaboration practices collected in an interview study of eight globally distributed interorganizational software development projects.On the basis of 34 semistructured interviews, we were able to identify several practices that the interviewees subjectively deemed successful. The identified collaboration practices include: milestone synchronization, frequent deliveries, and the establishment of peer-to-peer links. The need to plan for problem-solving communication was often neglected in the beginning of the project, despite its paramount importance. We identified several ways to ease related problems, such as having a dedicated person solve problems, using bulletin boards and e-mail lists or dedicated mailboxes. Successful projects had learned the value of two-way communication regarding project progress monitoring. Finally, practices helping in building and maintaining a working relationship included face-to-face meetings, distribution of organization charts, and having people travel to give all sites faces.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This study was concerned with determining whether techniques used to preserve these tissues and to prepare them for sectioning had an effect on spectral properties. The nu 1, nu 3 phosphate bands in the 900-1200 cm-1 spectral region were used to evaluate the structure of the apatitic mineral in fresh-frozen, ethanol-fixed, and formalin-fixed 35-day-old rat femurs; fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed 20-day-old fetal rat femurs; ground 35-day-old rat diaphyseal bone samples; and formalin-fixed, methacrylate-embedded ground diaphyseal bone. The crystallinity (crystal size and perfection) of the bone apatite was assessed by a curve-fitting analysis of the nu 1, nu 3 phosphate bands. Results indicate that ethanol or formalin fixation of the 35-day-old intact rat femur, and formalin fixation and embedding of the ground rat bone do not significantly alter the crystallinity of the apatite. However, formalin fixation of the fetal rat bone did alter the structure of the apatite mineral phase. In addition, evaluation of protein secondary structure in the 35-day-old rat femur from the Amide I and Amide II vibrations near 1650 and 1550 cm-1, respectively, revealed that protein conformation was altered by ethanol fixation.},

abstract = {This survey characterizes an emerging research area, sometimes called coordination theory, that focuses on the interdisciplinary study of coordination. Research in this area uses and extends ideas about coordination from disciplines such as computer science, organization theory, operations research, economics, linguistics, and psychology. A key insight of the framework presented here is that coordination can be seen as the process of managing dependencies among activities. Further progress, therefore, should be possible by characterizing different kinds of dependencies and identifying the coordination processes that can be used to manage them. A variety of processes are analyzed from this perspective, and commonalities across disciplines are identified. Processes analyzed include those for managing shared resources, producer/consumer relationships, simultaneity constraints, and tank/subtask dependencies. Section 3 summarizes ways of applying a coordination perspective in three different domains: (1) understanding the effects of information technology on human organizations and markets, (2) designing cooperative work tools, and (3) designing distributed and parallel computer systems. In the final section, elements of a research agenda in this new area are briefly outlined.},

Designing CPS requires approaches involving multi-disciplinary competences. However they are designed to be autonomous, the CPS presents a part of uncertainty, which requires inter-action with human for engineering, monitoring, controlling, performing operational maintenance, etc. This human-CPS interaction led naturally to the human in-the-loop (HITL) concept. Nevertheless, this HITL concept, which stems from a reductionist point of view, exhibits limitations due to the different natures of the systems involved. As opposed to this classical approach, we propose, in this paper, a model of Bio-CPS (i.e. systems based on an integration of computational elements within biological systems) grounded on theoretical biology, physics and computer sciences and based on the key concept of human systems integration.},

@article{Chen2011,
abstract = {This paper investigates the use of Petri nets for modeling coordinated cyber-physical attacks on the smart grid. Petri nets offer more flexibility and expressiveness than traditional attack trees to represent the actions of simultaneous attackers. However, Petri net models for attacks on very large critical infrastructures such as the smart grid require a great amount of manual effort and detailed expertise in cyber-physical threats. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a novel hierarchical method to construct large Petri nets from a number of smaller Petri nets that can be created separately by different domain experts. The construction method is facilitated by a model description language that enables identical places in different Petri nets to be matched. The new modeling approach is described for an example attack on smart meters, and its efficacy is demonstrated by a proof-of-concept Python program.},

@article{Smith2003,
abstract = {There is much talk today about a business process management (BPM) rEvolution. The revolutionary part is about a new category of software known as the business process management system (BPMS). The evolutionary part is about using the BPMS to exploit existing business and technology assets in a way that creates new value. Along with any revolution comes confusion. What exactly is BPM? Isn't it just workflow technology, which has been in use for twenty years, plus Web services? Why don't we describe what is going on today as the " new workflow rEvolution, " a subtle extension of workflow systems? To answer these questions, we explore the foundations of the workflow paradigm, and describe the paradigm shift in technology that is needed to overcome limitations of workflow systems to build and deploy robust business process management systems—the kind of information systems that businesses now demand as new sources of competitive advantage in an ever more uncertain and complex global economy.},
